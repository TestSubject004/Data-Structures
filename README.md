# Data Structures
A respository containing a basic,bare-bones implementation for the following data structures:
- Vectors
- Linked List (Singular and Double) 
- Trees
- Hash
- Maps
- Heaps

I have not included circular lists, stacks and queues as they can be created by modifying the code of the linked lists. The basic structure for those ADTs are similar.

I have not uploaded Trees,Hash,Maps and Heaps yet, so yeah, sorry about that. I will do it as soon as possible.
