# Data-Structures
A respository containing a basic,bare-bones implementation for the following data structures:
- Vectors
- Linked List (Singular and Double) 
- Trees
- Hash
- Maps
- Heaps
I have not included circular lists, stacks and queues as they can be created by modify the code of the linked lists. The basic structure for ADTs are similar.
